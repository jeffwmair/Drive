# Drive
3D Driving Game/Simulation in Java

Uses [J3DFW](https://github.com/jeffwmair/j3dfw), which is a really just a wrapper around the JOGL framework to add some additional helpful abstraction.
## Getting Started
```shell
git clone https://github.com/jeffwmair/Drive.git
cd Drive
mvn package
cd target/
java -jar Drive-1.0.jar
```
## Operation
### Car Control
* left mouse - hold to accelerate
* right mouse - hold to brake
* mouse pointer left/right movement to steer
* 1 - open/close the hood

### Camera Control
* mouse scroll wheel rotates the camera around the vehicle
* shift + mouse scroll adjusts the camera vertical angle
